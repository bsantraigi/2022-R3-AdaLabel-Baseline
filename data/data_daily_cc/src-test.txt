How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? [SEP] That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . [SEP] Really ? [SEP] Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . [SEP] Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? [SEP] Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . [SEP] How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? [SEP] That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . [SEP] So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? [SEP] Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . [SEP] Why did they want to found a college ? [SEP] Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . [SEP] Oh , I see . [SEP] Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . [SEP] When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? [SEP] In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . [SEP] It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . [SEP] Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .
Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? [SEP] I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it .

[SEP] But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? [SEP] Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U .

Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world ? [SEP] Which country makes the best coffee in the world ? [SEP] Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee . Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste . [SEP] I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? [SEP] Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee .
Good afternoon , sir . You are really a regular customer here . May I ask you why you come here so often ? [SEP] I'm a newspaper columnist . I write comments for a living . I enjoy working in a coffeehouse . [SEP] I see . But isn't it a bit too noisy ? [SEP] I don't mind . By contrast , I quite like the circumstances , as I can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life . [SEP] I can see that . Then what is your favorite coffee ? [SEP] Irish coffee is my favorite . But I can drink any other . I'm not particular on it . [SEP] All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? [SEP] Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . [SEP] I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . [SEP] Exactly .

We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . [SEP] Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?

But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .

Hey there Chris , what are you up to ? [SEP] I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models . [SEP] Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ? [SEP] Yeah , it looks that way .

[SEP] That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike . [SEP] Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order . [SEP] Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot . [SEP] So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting !

I've got to put together a sales pitch to give to our clients in the morning .

Hi , Mr . Brown , we have visited the factories and I'm very satisfied with your factories production conditions . [SEP] Yes , they are our main export bases of tools with the advantage of having good production experience and long historical record . All their products enjoy high prestige in the world market . [SEP] That's very good . But I have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers . I just want to know the details about that . [SEP] Ok , I'll show you how the packing is like . We have a showroom on the ground floor . Let's go downstairs and have a look . [SEP] Sure . [SEP] These are the various kinds of packing for pliers . Normally , we have three types of packing [SEP] Oh , the packing looks very nice . [SEP] The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market . It catches the eyes and can help push sales . [SEP] Good , what about the export packing ? [SEP] Well , they are packed in boxes of two dozens each , 100 boxes to a wooden case . [SEP] Is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? You see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . It's about 2,400 kilograms . [SEP] You can rest assured of that . So far , no customers have complained about our outer packing . [SEP] I'm glad to hear that . By the way , do you accept neutral packing ? [SEP] Yes , we can pack the goods according to your instructions .

So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ... [SEP] No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .

Mr Moon , how good to see you again . [SEP] Hello , Miao Ping , I'm here to chat with you about Corporate Agreement Savings . What can you tell me ?
