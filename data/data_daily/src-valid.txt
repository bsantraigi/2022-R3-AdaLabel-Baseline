Hello . Excuse me . [SEP] Yes . Can I help you ? [SEP] Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago . [SEP] Of course I remember you . [SEP] I think I lost my wallet here . [SEP] Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything . [SEP] Really ? You didn't find a wallet ? [SEP] No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ? [SEP] Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ? [SEP] No . It's been empty the whole time . [SEP] Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened . [SEP] I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ? [SEP] No . My friend did . [SEP] Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? [SEP] No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table . [SEP] Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home . [SEP] I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ? [SEP] Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that . [SEP] Should I call the police ? [SEP] You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .

[SEP] The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . [SEP] According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? [SEP] We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . [SEP] We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... [SEP] Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? [SEP] Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . [SEP] Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . [SEP] Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . [SEP] Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ?
I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks . [SEP] Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . [SEP] Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . [SEP] Do you sell direct to shops ? [SEP] Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . [SEP] Do you keep a stock of these things ? [SEP] In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . [SEP] That is , your commission . [SEP] Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . [SEP] Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission .

Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . [SEP] If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company .

It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . [SEP] If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . [SEP] Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .

I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt .

[SEP] Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .

I ’ m thinking about getting a pet , but I ’ m really not sure which animal would be suitable . Could you give me some advice ? [SEP] Certainly ! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . Dogs are very demanding . You need to take them for walks and they love to play . Cats , on the other hand , are more independent . [SEP] I ’ m fairly busy , so I really need an animal that I don ’ t need to care of very much . Actually , I ’ d like a pet that ’ s a little unusual . I don't ’ really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . Do you have any suggestions ? [SEP] Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . Is that a problem ? [SEP] Not really . By the way , I don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake . [SEP] We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after .

[SEP] There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . [SEP] And ? [SEP] So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . [SEP] And it's a brick ? [SEP] Yes . [SEP] I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? [SEP] I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . [SEP] So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . [SEP] Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . [SEP] But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? [SEP] He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! [SEP] What ? What did you buy ? [SEP] It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! [SEP] What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?

Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !

We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .

[SEP] That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
