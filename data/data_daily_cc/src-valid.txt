You know , I'm a pretty laid-back person . I don't like to have lots of arguments or worry about lots of things .

Every time I forgot to take my shoes off , she got really mad and made a big deal out of it .

Your definition on success ? [SEP] Most people think that wealth means success . But from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . On the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . The ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. With the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . And in toda / s society , If you have money , you seem to have everything . But this is not the case . I think success , on the other hand , also means satisfaction from work . It also means that you can get respect from others .

Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? [SEP] We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ?

Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order .

Lucy , what are your priorities when buying a car ? [SEP] I guess the first thing is the price , the second is the size , and of course the color will play a role too . But I have to be honest . It is our today ’ s responsibility to take care about our environment . Therefore , I will also pay attention to the fuel consumption of the car . You know , the rise in gasoline prices is huge . So I would rather to consider a smaller car with smaller engine . For which I can also save some tax . Last of the list , I also consider the safety .

What is your most preferred training method ? [SEP] Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues .

[SEP] Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? [SEP] Are there any seats available by the emergency exits ? [SEP] Let me see here ... yes , there's one left . [SEP] Ok . I'll take that one then . [SEP] Alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ? [SEP] I like to travel light so I just have this one . [SEP] If that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ? [SEP] Yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ?
Excuse me , how do I get to the Forbidden City ? [SEP] Follow this road and turn right at the second intersection . It'll be right there .
Excuse me , how do I get to the Forbidden City ? [SEP] Follow this road and turn right at the second intersection . It'll be right there . [SEP] Is it far ?

After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end .

Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it . [SEP] You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea .

[SEP] I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . [SEP] What did you do ? [SEP] I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . [SEP] Did he leave when you left ? [SEP] Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . [SEP] What did you do ? [SEP] He followed me all the way home ! [SEP] That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . [SEP] Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? [SEP] Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call .

[SEP] Oh , OK . [SEP] And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly .

And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly . [SEP] So , did you , did you lose your finger ? [SEP] Almost . [SEP] Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams . [SEP] Exactly . [SEP] Will you be going back to Australia soon ?
In spring , people are feeling refreshed . They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . They feel they are full of spirits and energy . [SEP] Women in particular . They are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress .

It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in .

[SEP] That might not be ideal because there would be some drawbacks to an annual contract situation that might make it difficult to sell to our buyers . What about free delivery ? If we make a large enough order , could you waive the deliver fee ? [SEP] Yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . We would have to insist on the annual contract , however . I understand it's not the most convenient for you . Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate .

You need good notes to help you remember . [SEP] I suppose you're right . But what can I do ? I don't know what to write down . [SEP] There are different things you can do.For one , the university offers a special free course on note-taking.You should go to the course . Also , I am pretty good at taking notes . I can help you on this exam . I will photocopy all my notes , and you can compare them to your notes.Then maybe you will see what kinds of things to write down . [SEP] That would really help me , Sue . I appreciate it . All this makes me feel like an idiot .
Oh ... I am really worried about the exam . I have no idea what will be on it . [SEP] Why ? Just read your notes.You can see what the professor stressed in the lectures.Probably the exam will ask about things he stressed . [SEP] Yes , but my notes are all nonsense . I can't figure out what is important . [SEP] Let me see them.Are these all the notes you have ? [SEP] Yes . [SEP] But Laurie , how can you do well in school if you don't take more notes ? [SEP] What do you mean ? You think I don't write enough . [SEP] I'm sure you don't write enough.Look at this . Here you wrote , Russian Revolution . 1917 . Bolsheviks . Real revolution , or coup ?

[SEP] That would really help me , Sue . I appreciate it . All this makes me feel like an idiot . [SEP] Don't feel that way . I know you are very smart.Note - taking is a special skill . All students need to learn it.Some people are very smart , but they just haven't learned how to take notes yet . I'm lucky because I had a good English teacher in high school.She taught me how to take good notes . It's not hard .

Do you have a carpenter's license ? [SEP] Yes , of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle . [SEP] Wow ! That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want . [SEP] Please go ahead , I am listening . [SEP] I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door . [SEP] Is your back door higher than the ground level ? [SEP] Yes , the back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground . [SEP] Okay , then you need a deck with a guardrail . [SEP] I don't like things to be fancy . [SEP] Don't worry . I will build your deck with a simple but classic look . [SEP] Hmm , that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ?
